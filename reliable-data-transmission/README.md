# Reliable Data Transmission
The raspberry pi Pico edition of the ["Error Detection" - Reliable data transmission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5YpKHXJDM) by Ben eater

## How to use
- Since There is no proper library for the HD44780 Lcd, we can use the LCD library by [dhylands](https://github.com/dhylands/python_lcd/tree/master/lcd). add these to the main directory of the pi pico as you are creating the project.
- Below are the circuit diagrams for the Sender and reciever respectively
